@Minor adjustments to comments.  Major correction to take
account of the fact that the possible prices must be determined
*separately* for each value of "q"; reversed the order of "R"
and "v" at the end (R - v rather than -v + R) so that "vdot"
gets the correct "xopt" attribute.

@Revised the initial comments substantially.  Put in a structure
to detect the piecewise linear setting, and to determine a set
of possible prices over which to do a discrete maximization.

allowed to be a vector of *possible* prices, over which to
optimize.  Argument "op" added to allow request for
