Description: Calculates the optimal price of assets (such as
	airline flight seats, hotel room bookings) whose value
	becomes zero after a fixed ``expiry date''.  Assumes
	potential customers arrive (possibly in groups) according
	to a known inhomogeneous Poisson process.  Also assumes a
	known time-varying elasticity of demand (price sensitivity)
	function.  Uses elementary techniques based on ordinary
	differential equations.  Uses the package deSolve to effect
	the solution of these differential equations.
