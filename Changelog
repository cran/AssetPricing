Version 0.0-10

* Submitted to CRAN 01/01/13.

* Changed call to .onLoad() to be a call to .onAttach() in
  the First.R file.

* Added a file declareGlobals.R which contains a call to
  globalVariables() which keeps R CMD check from issuing
  notes to the effect of "no visible binding for ...".

Version 0.0-9

* Submitted to CRAN 30/12/12.  Got complaint from the CRAN
  maintainers with respect to a couple of issues (see above)
  whence version 0.0-9 was never installed on CRAN.

* Reorganized the argument structure of plot.flap(); removed
  the "aao" argument --- its use is obviated by the newer
  "groups" argument.

* Made the default behaviour of plot.flap() be such that a
  *single* group of traces is produced.  This behaviour pertains
  when "groups" is unspecified or if the "group" column of "groups"
  is unspecified.  This behaviour is consistent with the former
  behaviour which arose when "aao" was set equal to TRUE.

* Did some corresponding (and other) revision of the help for
  plot.flap().

* Cosmetic change to code of turnPts() --- to make the code
  consistent with the (more perspicuous) notation in the paper
  about to be submitted.

* Re-ordered the entries of this file under "Version 0.0-7" so
  that the most recent change is listed first. (9 November 2012)

* Changed buildS() to assign the parent environment of S
  as globalenv() rather than new.env().  This keeps R from
  popping up a message "AssetPricing 0.0-9" when a workspace,
  in which a function returned by buildS() has been saved,
  is loaded. (9 November 2012).

* Corrected a bunch of spelling errors in the help files.
  (8 November 2012).

Version 0.0-8

* Changed the examples for xsolve() and vsolve() to make
  them run more quickly so as to reduce the time for package
  checking on CRAN.

Version 0.0-7 (Initial submission to CRAN, 7 November 2012).

* Adjusted vsolve() to throw an error if "jmax", as determined
  from "gprob" is greater than the "jmax" attribute of "x",
  and double indexing is in effect (i.e. "x" inherits from
  "di.flap").

* Adjusted buildS() so that "tmax" is an attribute of the
  returned value, rather than being assigned in the environment
  of the returned value.  Made the corresponding adjustment
  to the way that xsolve.pwl() accesses "tmax".

* Adjusted xsolve() and vsolve() to allow lambda to be a scalar
  constant as well as a function.

* Re-wrote the comments in scrF.

* Changed cev() to make use of "maxFac" and "xback" when
  doing discrete maximization over price.

* Added argument "maxFac" to xsolve; used by xsolve.disc()
  and xsolve.pwl() in choosing a maximum out of a finite
  discrete set (when there is some ambiguity about which
  maximum to use).  This gets rid of some anomalous looking
  discontinuities in the optimal price functions.
  Also added an object "xback" (the value of "x" at the
  previous Runge-Kutta time step) to be assigned in the
  environment of cev() by xsolve.pwl()) for use in selecting
  the appropriate "maximum" in a way which enhances continuity.

* Added new argument "main.panel" and changed the handling
  of "main".

* Adjusted putAway() in respect of the way the "jmax" attribute
  is handled.

* Changed the way "gloss" and "glind" are handled.

* Replaced the argument "index" by groups to provide for
  plotting of *groups* of traces (when "aao" is FALSE).

* Re-wrote plot.flap() to handling "doubly indexed" price
  arrays properly.

* Renamed the class "funlist" to "flap" (Function List
  for Asset Pricing).

* Created a new function findSolType() to determine the
  solution type --- cont, disc, or pwl.

* Re-wrote many comments in the code.

* Changed the name of an attribute of "funlist" objects
  from "xlim" to "tlim" (since the relevant variable is
  always referred to as "t").

* Made argument "type" default to "sip".

* Made argument "alpha" default to 1 when jmax=1 (so that it
  needn't be specified when jmax=1).

* Made argument tmax of vsolve() default to the upper limit
  of the "t"-axis associated with the argument "x".

* Re-ordered the arguments of vsolve(), xsolve(), xsolve.cont(),
  xsolve.disc() and xsolve.pwl().

* Made vsolve() able to cope with discrete prices (and with
  pwl price sensitivity functions.)

* Changed the name "parlist" to "parvec" to avoid confusion
  (since this object is a *vector* and NOT a list).

Version 0.0-6

* Added an argument "extend" to plot.funlist() --- controls
  how much the x-axis is extended to the right to accommodate
  the marginal gloss.  (It used to be fixed at 0.3, which is
  now the default value.)

* Corrected the references in the plot.funlist() help file;
  ``to appear'' is no longer applicable.

* Fixed a glitch in the examples for plot.funlist().

* Installed 2012-02-18

Version 0.0-5

* major debugging; corrected some very silly structure
  in xsolve.pwl(). Fixed a few other minor bugs in some
  other functions.

* changed the value out of range criterion in buildS.R
  to use eps = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)

* changed vsolve() and xsolve.disc() to use "tvec" r.t.
  incrementing tt by delta on each step.

* changed vsolve() to make use of putAway()

* changed putAway() to accommodate input from vsolve()
  (whereby "x" is already an object of class "funlist"
   which gets passed through as is).

* Installed 2012-02-01

Version 0.0-4

* added xsolve.pwl()

* added utility functions getPossPrices() and turnPts()
  upon which xsolve.pwl() ultimately depends.

* amended scrF() to call upon getPossPrices() appropriately.

* amended the way things are assigned into the environment
  of scrF() to accommodate the piecewise linear computations
  in a convenient manner.

* Installed 2012-01-25

Version 0.0-3

* Added xsolve.disc()
  Still need to add xsolve.pwl().

* Installed 2012-01-23

Version 0.0-2

* Added xsolve() to call upon xsolve.cont(), xsolve.disc(),
  or xsolve.pwl() as appropriate.  (The latter two functions
  are not yet written.)

* Changed over the documentation for xsolve.cont() to be
  documentation for xsolve (and made xsolve.cont() "internal").

* Added buildS and documentation for it.

* Installed 11 January 2012.

Version 0.0-1

* Adaptation of previously written "Apma", made to be better
  structured.

* Installed 20 November 2011.
